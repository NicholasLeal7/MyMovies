# MyMovies

A website about movies! It's a simple interface built on ReactJS and Sass that consumes TMDB (The Movie DataBase) API and shows datas
about recent movies.

The intention of this project is to practice my ReactJS habilities, developing the whole frontend using this framework to show the cards
and make the search bar functional. Soon, I intend to improve the functionalities of this project in future commits.
